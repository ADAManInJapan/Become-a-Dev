# Become-a-Dev
These are the initial practice exercises for writing secure smart contracts for Cardano-based projects.

Hello and thank you for reading my README for my project.

In this project, I aim to build up the chops and technical understanding of preparing smart contracts to be implemented on the Cardano Blockchain.
This means I will focus on the Haskell programming language, but supplemental Python or Javascript programs may be included here.

I am ADAManInJapan, an aspiring developer for the Cardano community.

I have been a lurker or ghost in Cardano for a couple of years now.

I WANT TO PLAY A LARGER ROLE IN DEVELOPING THE COMMUNITY TO FULFILL THE ENDEAVORS OF THE FOUNDERS, MAIN PLAYERS, AND POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS OF THIS BLOCKCHAIN.

I maintain strong convictions that Cardano is the likeliest blockchain to succeed in maintaining a secured and decentralized ledger for the global community.

If you are an EMPLOYER, than please review my repository of work here as proof-of-developmental-work or proof-of-education.
I will be publishing code that I develop in part of IOHK/EMURGO courses I will be taking.
If you are satisfied with my work, then I hope that we can work together in a more professional setting.

THE GOAL OF THIS REPOSITORY/PROJECT IS TO GET A JOB IN BLOCKCHAIN, SUPPORTING PROJECTS ON THE CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN.

If you've made it this far, thank you again and I hope you enjoy, learn from, or appreciate my work here.
